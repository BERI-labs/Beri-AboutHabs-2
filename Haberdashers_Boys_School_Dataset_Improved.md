## History

Founded in 1690 by Royal Charter using a bequest from Robert Aske to the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers. Originally at Hoxton in Shoreditch, the school moved to Hampstead in 1898 and to its current 100-acre site at Elstree in 1961. Aldenham House, a Grade II* listed English country house, became the school's centrepiece. Habs Boys is one of 11 schools around the country owned by the Haberdashers' Company.

In 2021, Robert Aske's name was dropped from the school following the discovery of his links with the Royal African Company and the slave trade. The motto was changed from "Serve and Obey" to "Together, boundless." The Hinton and Taylor buildings, comprising 46 classrooms, academic offices, and a drama studio, were completed in 2022.

## Vision and Values / Ethos

The school's vision is to be at the forefront of education. Its mission is to offer outstanding education that is fun, exciting, and intellectually challenging on a co-educational campus, developing independence, resilience, and a moral compass. Its purpose is to empower young people to make a profound impact in the world.

At Habs, education is about more than just knowledge — it is about character. Our pastoral care programme instils values of kindness, resilience, and respect, preparing our pupils to be compassionate leaders in their communities. Our strong emphasis on social responsibility encourages pupils to engage with global issues and to strive for positive change. Everything we do is underpinned by our four core values:

- **Ambition:** We set our sights high in terms of what we want to achieve as individuals and as a community. Bold, challenging the status quo, selfless lever for change.
- **Courage:** We are bold in our approach to learning and life. We are not afraid to take risks, make mistakes, and learn from them. Exploring beyond comfort zones, resilient, unflinching problem-solvers.
- **Curiosity:** We nurture inquisitive minds, encouraging students to ask questions, explore new ideas, and look beyond the curriculum. Questioning, creative, bringing awe and wonder to learning.
- **Community:** We look out for one another and are committed to making a positive difference to the world around us. We celebrate diversity and foster an inclusive environment where everyone belongs — caring, respectful, inclusive, locally and globally focused.

## Pastoral Support and Wellbeing

At Habs, we understand that a boy can only reach his full academic and co-curricular potential if he feels safe, happy, and supported. Our pastoral care system is highly structured and deeply embedded into school life.

### The Buddy System

All new pupils (whether joining in Reception, Year 3, Year 7, or Year 9) are assigned a "Buddy" from an older year group. Buddies act as mentors, answering questions, helping new boys navigate the campus, and providing a friendly, familiar face during the crucial first few weeks.

### Wellbeing and PSHE

Personal, Social, Health, and Economic (PSHE) education is a core part of the curriculum. Lessons cover mental health awareness, healthy relationships, online safety, and neurodiversity. We celebrate events like Neurodiversity Week to foster understanding and inclusion.

### Medical Centre

The school has a fully staffed, on-site Medical Centre. Trained nurses are available throughout the school day to administer first aid, manage chronic conditions, and support overall physical wellbeing.

## Academic Support and Special Educational Needs (SEN)

Habs is committed to inclusive excellence. Our Academic Support department works closely with teachers and parents to identify and assist students who may need extra help. We offer targeted interventions, study skills workshops, and individualised learning plans to ensure every boy can access the curriculum fully.

Our Heads of Department follow an evidence-informed "Framework for Great Teaching." This ensures lessons are planned thoughtfully, feedback is constructive and responsive, and pupil voice is actively listened to. We prioritise clarity, respect, and improvement, balancing empathy with high expectations. Students are regularly asked about their lessons, the variety of resources used, and the constructiveness of the feedback they receive.

The Habs Innovation Centre realises the school's vision to be at the forefront of education — not simply doing well at delivering the ordinary, but striving to be extraordinary. A dedicated Director of Innovation was appointed in April 2024 to lead this work across both schools.

The Centre's work over the coming years has five strands:

1. **Establishing the Habs Centre for Innovation** — including a test-bed classroom with observation options, CPD events, a pedagogy resource library, and teacher training sessions.
2. **Digital Innovation** — exploring how AI is used, and its role in learning and teaching.
3. **Curricular Innovation** — exploring areas where Habs can make a real difference, including Global Changemakers (EDI, sustainability and entrepreneurship) and Tech and Ethics (AI and civic responsibility).
4. **Habs Dispositions Project** — mapping the school's "Profound Impact" strategy and developing the role of our values in student development.
5. **Imagining the Future of Teaching** — research and development into pedagogy for a rapidly changing world.

The Centre recognises that schools are preparing students for futures not yet imagined. Creative and critical thinking, problem-solving, deep understanding, and effective collaboration will be essential — alongside literacy in big data, technology, and generative AI. The **Habs CyberSquad** has been crowned VEX V5 National Champions, and our robotics teams frequently compete internationally.

## Music

Music is central to life at Habs, exceptional both in quality and breadth of opportunity. There are over **70 ensembles a week** and one of the most dynamic concert programmes in the country. From one of the strongest school orchestras in the country to an award-winning Big Band, there are opportunities for every student — whether jazz or classical, Indian music or rock bands, chamber music or songwriting.

With London's world-class venues at hand, the school takes every opportunity to perform externally. Masterclasses with leading musicians, collaborations with new artists, tours, and studio recordings ensure students remain connected to the wider world of music.

**Recent performance highlights include:**
- Orchestral Concert at St John's Smith Square
- Chamber Music Concert at LSO St Luke's
- Jazz Evening at King's Place
- Big Band recording session at Abbey Road Studios
- Piano festival featuring over 200 performers across the school campus
- House Music Festival featuring over 500 performers
- Two original musicals written in collaboration with playwright James Fritz and songwriter Sam Griffiths
- Carol Service at St Albans Cathedral and singing at St Paul's Cathedral
- Choir performances at Cambridge and Oxford chapels
- A student performing as a finalist in BBC Young Jazz Musician
- The inaugural Habs Company of Schools' Music Festival

**Student successes:** Many students continue to music at the highest levels, including scholarships to the Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music, Guildhall, and Trinity Laban; music scholarships to US universities including Harvard and Stanford; participation in the National Youth Orchestra, National Youth Choir, London Schools' Symphony Orchestra, National Youth Musical Theatre, and West End productions.

A **Holiday Music Programme** offers courses in strings, jazz, woodwind, brass, Indian music, and rock bands, open to all students regardless of existing connection to the school.

Individual and group music lessons are available across a wide range of instruments (see Additional Costs section for fees), including piano, strings, woodwind, brass, guitar, voice, percussion, and traditional instruments such as Tabla, Dhol, and Dholak.

## Drama and Film

At Habs, drama and film are taken seriously as creative disciplines. The department takes a fresh, ambitious approach — moving away from traditional school plays to focus on new, innovative, and creatively ambitious work that puts the process of making at its heart. Students are trained as theatre-makers, encouraged to take creative responsibility, take risks, and find their own authentic voices.

**Productions and performances:** The school runs at least three large-scale productions per year, plus participation in the Coram Shakespeare Schools Festival, the National Theatre New Views playwriting programme, and numerous House Drama events. Recent productions include *Brief Encounter* (jointly with Habs Girls), *Romeo and Juliet*, *Brainstorm*, *All The Things I Never Said*, and *Where We End Up*.

Industry professionals regularly collaborate with students, including playwrights James Fritz, Simon Longman, Ella Frears, and Andrew Muir; theatre-makers Matt Harrison, Joyce Henderson, and Marc Benga; and movement directors Kane Husbands and Rachel-Leah Hosker. Alongside productions, there is a thriving programme of drama clubs, external workshops, improvisation classes, and writing mentorship each term.

**Film production:** The school offers professional film-making training — scriptwriting, directing, acting for screen, camera operation, and cinematography. Several film projects are produced annually with professional collaborators. The school has developed a full-length feature film, *Tiny Acts of Revolution*, working with Tea Films, alongside music videos and short films.

**National recognition:** Over eight years, 35 Habs Boys and Habs Girls students have been accepted into the **National Youth Theatre of Great Britain**. Several Habs students have had plays professionally read at the National Theatre; Jamila Salim's play *Colour Outside the Lines* was bought by Audible for professional production.

**Performance spaces:**
- The Lime Tree Studio — a state-of-the-art, purpose-built drama studio and rehearsal space
- A 550-seat performance hall with extensive digital production facilities
- An additional purpose-built black-box studio for teaching and examination shows

Students can take on technical roles — lighting, sound, AV — alongside acting, directing, stage management, set design, costume, make-up, and video design.

## Diversity and Inclusion

Habs is proud of the huge range of cultures, backgrounds, identities, and beliefs represented in its community. This diversity is both welcoming for students and an invaluable preparation for life in a diverse society and globalised world.

The school has its own **Head of Diversity and Inclusion**, who directs the approach to student admissions and welfare, curriculum-building, staff recruitment, and teacher training. All students and staff are encouraged to be effective **active bystanders** — aware of, and willing to challenge, inappropriate or threatening behaviour.

**Faith at Habs:** Students come from a wide range of faith backgrounds. Spirituality is a regular dimension of school life. Regular assemblies are held for Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Humanist, Jain, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh communities.

**Practical inclusion:**
- Lunch options include vegetarian, non-beef, halal, and kosher; fasting for faith reasons is respected and accommodated.
- Events and parties are held around Christmas, Hanukkah, Eid, and Diwali.
- A **multi-faith room** is available for all students.
- The annual **Pride Party** is a festival-like celebration open to all students and staff.
- Students can join faith and identity clubs including African and Caribbean Society, Christian Union, Muslim Society, JSoc, South Asian Society, LGBT+ Society, Hindu Society, and TamilSoc, among others.

**Disabilities and additional needs:** The school makes reasonable adjustments for students with physical disabilities, sensory impairments, and learning or cognitive conditions (including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and dyscalculia). Exam arrangements can include modified papers, extra time, a reader or assistant, bilingual dictionaries, and assistive technology. Provision applies from the admissions process through to examinations.

The school also operates a generous **bursary programme** so that financial circumstances do not prevent the brightest students from attending.
